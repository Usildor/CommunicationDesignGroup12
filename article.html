	<span class="introduction">A youth club</span> is definitely a valuable institution for every community. But it needs more than just
 to have a place for the youth to go to. Otherwise it can do more harm than good. According to the
 Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), ‘just hanging out at a club can have a detrimental impact
 on young people’s lives, making them more likely to smoke, drink and become teenage parents’. Youth clubs
 need to offer activities like sports or arts to help children and teenagers which will give them structure
 in their lives.<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6917077.stm">(read more)</a>
</br>
</br>
 Østsiden Youth Club in Fredrikstad offers such activities for his members and is a great example how it should be.
 Ruben Johansen tells what he likes about the youth club and how it helped him to develop his personality.

		<span class="introduction">It all started in 2005,</span> several youth clubs around Norway had to be cut from the communal budget and got closed down.
	In Fredrikstad this was no different. For the years to come after that more public youth clubs got closed in and around
	Fredrikstad and the teenagers living there felt betrayed. 10 Years later, and the budgets for the youth clubs hadn’t
	increased too much and the ones that were open didn’t have the resources to do maintenance on equipment or the buildings
	they were in. </br></br> But in 2015 teenagers in Fredrikstad decided that enough was enough and took the matter into their own hands.
	They posted a very well written article on a webpage called “Minsak.no” they explained and argued for a brand new and more
	developed club <a href="https://minsak.no/sak/683">(read more)</a>. This article also included a petition where teenagers and youth who would like
	such a club to open, could sign the petition. This turned out to be the case and they got  399 signatures! This started a
	big project which opened only 5 weeks ago.

The club Østsiden came as a new club this year, and opened 14. September. The club came as a result of an article written by a very engaged youth who was afraid of every club shutting down.

I think it’s important to challenge yourself in an arena which is not the school environment or the home environment. This leads to development of social skills which can be challenging to acquire for everybody in today's school systems. At the same time the youth are in an age where the state of mind reorganize every day and you get your chances to become something good. In this period I think it’s important to give good experiences and some tools to succeed in life, and maybe also help them to find some love, says Heine cheeky.<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>
