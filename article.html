	   			<span class="letters">The Interview with Ruben Johansen, the youth club member.</span>
	  		</span>
		</h2>


<h5>Tell me abit about yourself</h5>
<p>My name is Ruben Johansen and I am 15 years old, soon to be 16. The things I do the most is play video games, watch Netflix series, and hang out with my friends. Like a regular teenager, he says and laughs.</p>

<h5>What do you like most about the youth club?</h5>
<p>The thing I like the most about the youth club is the music there, it is amazing. Kind of feel like a “party” person inside, even though i’m too young to party. But that is what got me hooked and makes me still wanna go.</p>

<h5>How often do you go to the youth center?</h5>
<p>I tend to be there every time, if it’s closed for some reason i’m often bugging the leaders for why it isn’t open and when will it open again. So basically one to two times a week.</p>

<h5>What do you like the most to do at the club?</h5>
<p>I like to talk with my friends, listen to the music and also play 8 ball pool. That is really fun. But i’ve had a DJ-course there and bought my own DJ gear, so I really like to play the music and that’s the main reason i’m even there to begin with.</p>

<h5>What did you do in your spare time when you didn’t go to the youth center?</h5>
<p>I didn’t do much before going to the youth center, I was just at home playing games and being a “shut-in.”</p>

<h5>Did something in your life/sparetime change since you started going to youth clubs?</h5>
<p>Some things changed my life there. I had major anxiety for meeting people and as I said, a bit of a “shut-in.” But after I started going there i’ve opened up more and the anxiety is almost gone. I still get the chills sometime, but it isn’t half as bad as it was before. So I have become a better person and now i’m able to hang out with the friends I made more, because I dont panic in social situations.</p>

<h5>Why do you think a youth club is a good thing for teenagers?</h5>
<p>The youth club is a good place to go to because they bring out joy and happiness from people. You can hangout, chill or just talk to people. No one is keeping the time or stressing, it’s just a place to hangout and be yourself.</p>

<h5>Do you have any experiences in particular you want to share?</h5>
<p>I have been going to two different youth clubs in Fredrikstad for almost 4 years now, and of course there has been bad experiences there. Like in the start I was too afraid to do anything and mostly kept to myself, but something and people around kept “pushing” me to go. After a while I became more open and people started to talk to me and we shared our interests and here we are, I have overcome my fear of interacting with other people, mostly - he adds winking with his eye.

	   			<span class="letters">The Interview with Heine Knutsen, The leader.</span>
	  		</span>
		</h2>


<h5>Tell me briefly about yourself.</h5>
<p>My name is Heine, I work as a department manager for “Fritid i Fredrikstad”. I have worked there since the start of 2007, and I have my main office at St.croix in Fredrikstad. For the time being I am managing two youth clubs in Fredrikstad called Torsnes and Østsiden. The club Østsiden came as a new club this year, and opened 14. September. The club came as a result of an article written by a very engaged youth who was afraid of every club shutting down. (The article can be read in Norwegian here: https://minsak.no/sak/683) </p>

<h5>When did the planning of the new youth center begin?</h5>
<p>We got the budget for the club in 2015 and started immediately to look for spaces and properties. We were at places as the female prison in the old town of Fredrikstad, a place called Kommandantgården, Brohuset and many more but ended up on Borgarveien 18.</p>

<h5>So what is the age range on the teenagers/children visiting the club?</h5>
	<p>We have a age limit from 10 to 18 years of age. This year the most of the visitors are
	from 15 - 18 years of age. This can vary from year to year depending on generations
going in and out.</p>

<h5>What has been the biggest challenge so far opening a new club</h5>
<p>The biggest challenge with opening a new club must have been the renovate and customize the new building, since before we got our hands on the building it was a commercial building. So we had to rectify and build new toilets, showers etc. This have made it a bit hard on the development, and we’ve had more than a fair share of rounds with the labor inspection unit.</p>

<h5>Why do you think it is important to have youth clubs in Fredrikstad?</h5>
<p>I think there is many reasons to that. I think it’s important to challenge yourself in an arena which is not the school environment or the home environment. This leads to development of social skills which can be challenging to acquire for everybody in today's school systems. At the same time the youth are in an age where the state of mind reorganize every day and you get your chances to become something good. In this period I think it’s important to give good experiences and some tools to succeed in life, and maybe also help them to find some love, says Heine cheeky.</p>

<h5>How many teenagers visit the club?</h5>
<p>The last two years we’ve been between 20.000 - 35.000 teenagers yearly. The visitor numbers depends a lot on seasons and generation changes which leads to the older teenagers being too old and that the newcomers that is 10 years old have to be picked up and advertised to that there is a option for them to come and join the fun. This change happens maybe once every 2nd year, and at that point we kind of have to “start over.” </p>


<h5>What do you like most about leading youth clubs? and what do you like the least?</h5>
<p>The best part about being the club leader is to be in touch with the youth and to be of help for them, help them realize their dreams, help them take responsibility and to see the growth in the youngsters which keeps on returning to the club until they are older then the age limit. And it is particularly fun to see the youth starting to reflect about themselves, that’s the most fun about doing my job.

It’s the times where things doesn’t turn out like you want them to that being the leader can be tough, where you maybe have had relations with some of them and then you just get overwhelmed by the feeling that you couldn’t do anything for them. </p>

<h5>What is the future plans for the new club?</h5>
<p>We still have activities in the club which is not done yet. We opened the club before everything we wanted was in place, so the plan forward is to develop the club future bringing in more activities for the youth, like paintball, laser tag, a scene to perform on, DJ table and music system, a dance floor and that’s only some of the activities that’s already is being worked on. But the main attraction we are doing in near future is that we are going to teach the kids to walk on water. </p>
